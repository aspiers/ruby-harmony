## Description

`harmony` is a Ruby library which understands a fair amount about
modern musical harmony theory: notes, pitches, accidentals, intervals,
chords, clefs, scales, modes, and the relationships between these.
Using the library, you can perform quite complex calculations
involving music harmony, and even render music via LilyPond.  For
example, see [Scale Matcher](http://scalematcher.adamspiers.org/), a
Rails application which was built on top of this code.
